//TODO - Bounce Easing

// Bounce easing simulates the behavior of a physical object falling and bouncing before settling.
// It’s not about subtlety, it’s about fun, impact, and attention.

//* In GSAP, you get three variations of Bouncing:

// ease: "bounce.in"     // bounces as it enters
// ease: "bounce.out"    // bounces as it finishes
// ease: "bounce.inOut"  // bounces on both ends

//? When to use?

// Use bounce easing when you want an animation to feel playful or energetic, or Mimic physics (falling, landing, dropping) that grabs the user’s attention.

// It’s ideal for toasts or alerts dropping in, cards landing into place, floating UI elements snapping into view, or button entrances on onboarding or gamified flows.
